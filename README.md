HTML5-Photoshop-Sprite-Sheet-Creator
====================================


**Updated version**
However, the Sprite Sheet was created in the same Document and a CTRL+Z didn't undo the changes. All previous modifications, that were not saved were lost. This updated version duplicates the current Document and creates the Sprite Sheet within that new Document.

**Based on William Malone's Sprite Sheet Creator**
